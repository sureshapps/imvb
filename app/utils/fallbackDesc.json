"A blood black nothingness began to spin.  Began to spin.  Let's move on to system.  System.  Feel that in your body.  The system.  What does it feel like to be part of the system?  System.  Is there anything in your body that wants to resist the system?  System. Have they created you to be a part of the system?  System.  We're going to go on.  Cells.  They were all put together at a time.  Cells.  Millions and billions of them.  Cells.  Were you ever arrested?  Cells. Have you ever been in an instituion?  Cells.  Do they keep you in a cell?  Cells.  When you're not performing your duties do they keep you in a little box?  Cells.  Interlinked.  What's it like to hold the hand of someone you love?  Interlinked.  Do they teach you how to feel finger to finger?  Interlinked.  Do you long for having your heart interlinked?  Interlinked.  Do you dream about being interlinked?  Have they left a place for you where you can dream?  Interlinked.  What's it like to hold your child in your arms?  Interlinked.  What's it like to play with your dog?  Interlinked.  Do you feel that there's a part of you that's missing?  Interlinked.  Do you like to connect to things?  Interlinked.  What happens when that linkage is broken?  Interlinked.  Have they let you feel heartbreak?  Interlinked.  Did you buy a present for the person you love?  Within cells interlinked.  Why don't you say that three times?  Within cells interlinked.  Within cells interlinked.  Within cells interlinked."
